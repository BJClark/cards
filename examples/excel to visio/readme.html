<h2>What is it?</h2>
<hr/>

<p>
this tool will take an excel spreadsheet with a hierarchical story list in it, and generate
a "card wall" in visio from it.
</p>

<p style="text-align:right">

<i>a "card wall"</i>
</p>

<p>
the spreadsheet might look like - <a href="business processes.xls">business processes.xls</a>
</p>

<p>
and the card wall might look like - <a href="TPS.vsd">TPS.vsd</a><br>
</p>




<h2>Installation</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>You will need:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Windows - sorry only works on windows right now...
<li>Excel
<li>Visio
<li>Ruby - download it from here - <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/">http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/</a>
</ul>

<p>
Once you have all those installed, you can test your installation by double clicking the
"generate card walls.rb" file.  It should open excel for a second, then open up visio and
generate 2 card walls.
</p>

<h3>The Driver File</h3>

<p>
What the card wall generator does is configured by the "generate card walls.rb" file.  Open
it up and take a look.  You should see stuff like :
</p>

<code><pre>
     data = load_excel_data 'Business Processes.xls', 1
     create_visio_document data, 'Caution.vsd'
</pre></code>

<p>You can customize this for your needs.  Basically copy these 2 lines for every card wall
you want to create, and substitute these for the values :
<ul>
<li>excel file with the master story list - "Business Processes.xls"
<li>index of the sheet within the excel file - "1"
<li>visio file that will be created - "Caution.vsd"
</ul>
</p>

<p>Visit the project website at :</p>

<p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/cardwallgen">http://rubyforge.org/projects/cardwallgen</a></p>

<p>The documentation is still pretty sparse.  If you can find someone that knows ruby, have them poke
around, and they'll probably be able to figure out how to do most things.  Otherwise, email the list
at cardwallgen-users@rubyforge.org, or sign up for the list at the project website.</p>
