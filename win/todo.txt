We're currently using the tool for the CIT Enterprise Asset Management project.  Things we would like to see and/or retain:

Keep the id's.  We use them to reference other artifacts.
Add some automatic way to update all ids when inserting or deleting a row.
Prevent some of the masking in lower cells from disappearing when we edit the text in a cell
Retain 3x5 card size in the Visio output, at least as an option.

Thanks.

1) do you use the "update" feature of the tool?  - we don't it doesn't work very well, and if no one else does, I was going to get rid of it

>> No - didn't know there was one (must have missed it in the comprehensive documentation ;-)

2) do you use id's in your stories?  - again, in a quickstart it's just noise, it was originally there so that we could update paper w/ cards, but I find it's easier to just mark up the paper w/ markers and post-its

>> Yes - pleased keep this (or the option to turn it on / off), have found it very useful

3) are you attached to the current size of the cards in visio?  - we changed them to 3" x 3" which is the size of small post its (at least here in the states)

>> Not especially - but is there any chance we could have them configurable with some kind of sensible default?

4) is there anything else that you'd love to see in the tool that's not already there?  - can't promise anything, but it'd be good to get a list of cool things to add to it

>> GUI for driving it / integration with Windows explorer (How cool would it be to right click on the XLS and drive it from there? Schweet) (Personal prioritisation: Medium)
>> Option to have it overwrite automatically and not throw a wobbly if the file already exists (Personal prioritisation: High)
>> Configurable card size (as above) (Personal prioritisation: High)
>> Ability to configure when the app wraps to the next column - at the moment you get 5 yellow / detail cards before it starts another column - it would be great to have a few more to handle large volumes (Personal prioritisation: Medium)
>> Ability to add an overall title to the output (Personal prioritisation: High)
>> Ability to add filename / version info to output (Personal prioritisation: Low)
>> Ability to configure card colours / add different types (Personal prioritisation: Low)
